\chapter{Introduction}{
The main focus of this project is to create a programming language for parallel computing. Besides that, it has been chosen to delimit the scope of the project furthermore by choosing a target group for the language. Making a general purpose language optimised for parallel programming, is a large problem that has been attempted solve many times\cite{parallel programming languages}.
\\The aim of the project is not to solve this problem, but rather focusing on creating a language that is useful in solving a specific group of problems. The programming language will be targeted towards scientists with a focus on simulations of physical systems on highly parallel systems such as supercomputers and cluster computers. This field has long been spearheaded by C and Fortran, which admittedly are very powerful and efficient programming languages, but are beginning to show their age and both lack a lot of prominent functionalities, such as pattern matching, foreach loops and infinite precision integers.
The language, described in this report, therefore aims to modernise this niche field and attempt to take over the reigns from the giants of yesteryear.
