\mypart{Introduction}{The main focus of this project is to create a programming language for parallel computing. Besides that it has been chosen to delimit the scope of the project further more by choosing a target group for the language. Making a general purpose language optimized for parallel programming, is a large problem that has been attempted solve many times\cite{parallel programming languages}.
\\The aim of the project is not to solve this problem, but rather focusing on creating a language that is useful in solving a specific group of problems. The programming language will be focused on simulations of physical systems. It has been assumed that this kind of problem is often non-deterministic, which benefits the project because most parallel programming models introduce non-deterministic computations. 
\\The above delimitations makes the target user group of the language scientists and mathematicians. This has to be kept in mind during the development phase of the language.}\label{part:introduction}
