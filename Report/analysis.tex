\chapter{Problem Domain}\label{part:analysis}

In this chapter, the problem domain will be explained and analysed, in order to provide a better understanding of the intentions with The Language Described in this Report, and the reasoning upon which choices and delimitations will be made. The chapter will briefly cover reasons for modelling and different approaches to modelling a real world scenario.
Following this is a section on simulations in general, and specific ways of doing theoretical simulations. This also addresses some problems with the creation of computer simulations, and how such a problem can be viewed.

\chapter{Conditions for a Simulation Language}\label{part:analysis2}

In this chapter, we will examine certain technological tools for handling problems within the domain of computer simulations. This will include a section on high performance computing (HPC), which will cover the systems that typically compute simulations. Right after the HPC section will be a section on parallelism, based on theory from computer science. This section on parallelism covers the attractiveness of parallelism, as well as the problems which can occur in a parallel system. Then a section on the different memory architectures used in parallelism, and a section on the usage of the Message Passing Interface (MPI).

This all precedes a section on the actor model, and how this model can be used to do simulations, and where problems can arise with it.
