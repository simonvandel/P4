\chapter{Problem Domain}\label{part:analysis}

In this chapter, we will expand on our view of the problem domain of simulations, in order to better provide an understanding of our intentions with The Language Described in this Report, and the basis upon which we argue. The chapter will briefly cover reasons for modelling and different approaches to modelling. Following this is a section on simulations in general, and specific ways of doing theoretical simulations. This also addresses some problems with the creation of computer simulations, and how such a problem can be viewed.

\chapter{Theory}\label{part:analysis2}

In this chapter, we will examine certain technological tools for handling problems within the domain of computer simulations. This will include a section on High Performance Computing (HPC), which is the way to do simulations, and how this is done today. Right after the HPC section, a section on parallelism, based on theory from computer science. This section on parallelism covers the attractiveness of parallelism, as well as the problems which can occur in a parallel system. Then a section on the different memory architectures used in parallelism, and a section on the usage of MPI.

This all precedes a section on the Actor Model, and how this modelling method can be used to do simulations, and also where problems can arise.
