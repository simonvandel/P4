\chapter{Discussion}

Here a discussion on future development plans will follow. It will examine ideas that was not imlemented, but was considered by the group for future adition. The discussion will consider the results of adding features to TLDR, and how the principles of the language could have been futher supported or changed by those.

TLDR, being a language focused on allowing easy modelling shares a lot of principles with object oriented programming languages, and so the inclusion of common object oriented features is a likely idea. Including inheritance in some form or another would be a good way to allow for faster and more precise programming. Possible candidates could be traits, interfaces, abstract actors or some type of inheiritance. Interfaces could be very useful for making sure that messages are only sent to actors which actually implements a receive for that message, while still allowing multiple types of actors to be candidates. The usefulness of inheiritance or other ways of sharing functionalities across different actors, are also a good idea, since it will allow for more concise code and faster writing.

Another matter is the support for discrete simulations, as described in \cref{iterprob}. The solutions suggested are based around grouping actors into units, which work isolated from the rest of the actors. This idea of grouping actors, could potentially be used for other purposes, such has highly modular programs and functionalities, and promote purity when writing code in TLDR. But what is more interesting, is the possibility of a change of focus, from having the programmer think in terms of how actors mimic real things, to focusing on having environments mimic the conditions reality sets for things. Examples could be chemistry or physics, where one could want to find the optimal conditions for a chain reaction to occur. This problem could be approached by creating a single version of the actor, and then have the environments implement the changes in values, temperatures, pressure or what itr might be. Such an apporach might be useful for problems where certain objects behavior can be discribed through know matematical structures, but where the conditions can change immensely and by extension, the results of a given simulation.
