\section{Embarrassingly Parallel Problems}
Some examples of embarrassingly parallel problems include:

    Distributed relational database queries using distributed set processing
    Serving static files on a webserver to multiple users at once.
    The Mandelbrot set, Perlin noise and similar images, where each point can be calculated independently.
    Rendering of computer graphics. In computer animation, each frame may be rendered independently (see parallel rendering).[dubious – discuss]
    Brute-force searches in cryptography. Notable real-world examples include distributed.net and proof-of-work systems used in cryptocurrencies.
    BLAST searches in bioinformatics for multiple queries (but not for individual large queries) [7]
    Large scale face recognition that involves comparing thousands of arbitrary acquired faces (e.g. a security or surveillance video via closed-circuit television) with similarly large number of previously stored faces (e.g., a "rogues gallery" or similar watch list).[8]
    Computer simulations comparing many independent scenarios, such as climate models.
    Genetic algorithms and other evolutionary computation metaheuristics.
    Ensemble calculations of numerical weather prediction.
    Event simulation and reconstruction in particle physics.
    The Marching squares algorithm
    Sieving step of the quadratic sieve and the number field sieve.
    Tree growth step of the random forest machine learning technique.
