\subsection{Primitive Operators}
\label{subsec:primitiveOps}

Primitive operations are the operations that are build into the language.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Operators}
\label{sec:mathOps}

The following mathematical operations are built into the language.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{+} A binary operator that adds two numbers of the same type
  \item \textbf{-} A binary operator that subtracts two numbers of the same type
  \item \textbf{/} A binary operator that divides two numbers of the same type
  \item \textbf{\%} A binary operator that returns the remainder of a floored division of two numbers of the same type
  \item \textbf{\^}  A binary operator that lifts the first number to the power of the second number
  \item \textbf{\#} A binary operator that roots the first operand to the second operand
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Logical Operations}
\label{sec:logicOps}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{=} A binary operator that compares the two operands for equality. Returns true if equal. False otherwise.
  \item \textbf{!=} A binary operator that compares the two operands for equality. Returns true if not equal. False otherwise.
  \item \textbf{<} A binary operator that compares the two operands. Returns true if the first operand is strictly less than the second operand. False otherwise.
  \item \textbf{<=} A binary operator that compares the two operands. Returns true if the first operand is less than or equal to the second operand. False otherwise.
  \item \textbf{>} A binary operator that compares the two operands. Returns true if the first operand is strictly greater than the second operand. False otherwise.
  \item \textbf{>=} A binary operator that compares the two operands. Returns true if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand. False otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Boolean Operations}
\label{sec:boolOps}

The following operations only operate on bool types.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{AND} A binary operator that returns true if both values are true. False otherwise
  \item \textbf{OR} A binary operator that returns true if at least one value is true. False otherwise
  \item \textbf{XOR} A binary operator that returns true if only one operand is true. False otherwise
  \item \textbf{NOT} A unary operator that returns the opposite value of the operand.
  \item \textbf{NAND} A binary operater that returns true if none or a single operand is true. False otherwise
\end{itemize}
