\subsubsection{Match-statements}
\label{subsec:matchStatements}

Match statements can be seen as syntactical sugar for multiple chained if-statements. The syntax is as follows.

\begin{verbatim}
  match <whatToMatchOn> {
    <case1> -> <actionOnCase1>
    <case2> -> <actionOnCase2>
    ...
    <caseN> -> <actionOnCaseN>
  }
\end{verbatim}

A concrete example:

\begin{verbatim}
  match (1, 2) {
    (0, n) -> // this case will never be reached
    (1, n) -> print("Case reached!");
    _ -> // default case that matches everything
  }
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Delimitation}

Due to other work being deemed more importantly, match statements will not be further developed. A future improvement to TLDR could possibly include match statements.
