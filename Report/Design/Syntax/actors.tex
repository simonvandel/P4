\subsection{Actors}
\label{sub:actors}

Actors are declared using the \emph{actor} keyword in the following way. Behaviour can be given to an actor by declaring receive actions using the \emph{receive} keyword in the body of the actor.

\begin{verbatim}
  actor <actorName> := {<body>}
\end{verbatim}

A concrete example:

\begin{verbatim}
  actor earth := {
    var temperature:real := 0;
    receive sunlight:light := {
      temperature := temperature + 0.1;
    }
  }
\end{verbatim}
