\subsection{Meta type}
\label{sub:meta_type}

It has been decided to design the language in a manner that insures that all type checking can be done at compile time. To insures this all identifier's must have explicit type declaration. A meta type is in this report defined as a type which can be an instance of any other type in the language.  The functionally which spawns a new actor needs to know of which type the actor should be of, in this case a meta type would be useful to describe the actual type of the actor.
So to imagine a meta type in this language, it would look something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
  let x:Type := Int
\end{verbatim}
In fact $typeX$ is just a placeholder for a type the following expression should evaluate to int and the declaration of $y$ would be fine. Bu notice that type is declared using the var keyword which makes an variable mutable. If $typeX$ is mutable it can change state doing runtime, and in this case the type of $y$ can not be determined at compile time, which has disagrees with the premise mentioned before. 

\begin{verbatim}
  var typeX:Type := Int
  let y:typeX := 4
\end{verbatim}
Different solutions for this problem have been considered, one way of doing it is to disallow mutable meta type. This solution insures that the meta type can't change at runtime, and there for the type can be determined at compile time. Another way of doing it could be to disallow a variable to be type declared using a meta type. Because of orthogonality it has been decided to not implement any kind of meta type, with this solution there will be no confusion about how a meta type can be declared and no to be declared. 
In \cref{sub:constructionOfAnActor} it's describe how it's possible to spawn an actor without the use of a meta type.
