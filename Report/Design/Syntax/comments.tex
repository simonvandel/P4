\subsection{Comments}
\label{sec:comments}

Text only relevant to the reader of a piece of code is called a comment. Comments therefore has no meaning to the parser and is ignored. Comments are declared in C style by \enquote{//} being a single line comment and \enquote{/**/} being a multi line comment.

A concrete example:

\begin{verbatim}
  // this is a single line comment
  /* this is
     a
     multi line comment */
\end{verbatim}
