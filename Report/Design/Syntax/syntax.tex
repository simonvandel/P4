\subsection{Syntax}
\label{sec:syntax}
In this section, will present and discuss some considerations made regarding the syntax of this language. The aim of this section is to provide insight into the constructs of the language, why they have taken thier form.
%The syntax should reflect the semantics of the language
%and serve as a reference guide to users of the language.
The primitive data types and operators will be described in \cref{subsec:primitives,subsec:primitiveOps}. After this, functions and their declarations are explained in \cref{subsec:functions}. Next, comments will be briefly mentioned in \cref{subsec:comments}, followed by assignment, or binding, of values to symbols in \cref{subsec:value_assignment}. After this, more complex syntactical constructs, such as actors, structures, loops and selective control structures, will be explained in \cref{subsec:actors,subsec:structs,subsec:forLoopStatements,subsec:ifStatements}.
