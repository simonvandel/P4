\section{Syntax and Semantics}
\label{sec:syntax}
In this section, will present and discuss some considerations made regarding the syntax and semantics of this language. The aim of this section is to provide insight into the constructs of the language, why they have taken their form.

The primitive data types and operators will be described in \cref{subsec:primitives,subsec:primitiveOps}. After this, functions and their declarations are explained in \cref{subsec:functions}. Next, comments will be briefly mentioned in \cref{subsec:comments}, followed by assignment, or binding, of values to symbols in \cref{subsec:value_assignment}. After this, more complex syntactical constructs, such as actors, structures, loops and selective control structures, will be explained in \cref{subsec:actors,subsec:structs,subsec:forLoopStatements,subsec:ifStatements}.

\section{Semantics}\label{semantics}
This section describes the semantics of the constructs in TLDR both formally and informally. It is split into pieces each describing one construct both formally and informally.

\subsection{Formal semantics in TLDR}
To describe the semantics formally it was decided to use small-step semantics. The alternative was big-step semantics but since the language depends heavily on non-determinism and parallelism and this is not possible to represent in big-step semantics, small-step semantic was a better choice.

The formal rules have three parts as illustrated in \cref{SS-semantics}

												{,[SIDE-CONDITION]}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Actor-Environment model}
The formal semantics will also use an actor-environment model.

$a = \text{Anames} \cup \{next\} \rightharpoonup e \times st$

$e = \text{Symbols} \rightharpoonup \text{Stm} \times \text{Symbols}$
$st = \text{Structs} \rightharpoonup \text{Stm}$
$at = \text{ActorTypes} \rightharpoonup \text{Stm}$

\subsection{General Constructs}
\begin{align*}
&\inference[$\text{INVOKE}$]{\Braket{S_1,e[p_1' \mapsto \Braket{S_2,p_2'}]} \Rightarrow_S \Braket{S_1',e'}}
                  {\Braket{p_1(p_2),e} \Rightarrow_S \Braket{S_1',e'}}
\\
&									{,e(p_1) = \Braket{S_1,p_1'}, e(p_2) = \Braket{S_2,p_2'}}
\end{align*}
