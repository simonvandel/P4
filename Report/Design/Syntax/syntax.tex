\section{Syntax}
\label{sec:syntax}
In this chapter, the syntax for the language, described in this report, will be explained in detail. The primitive data types and operators will be described in \cref{subsec:primitives,subsec:primitiveOps}. After this, functions and their declarations are explained in \cref{subsec:functions}. Next, comments will be briefly mentioned in \cref{subsec:comments}, followed by assignment, or binding, of values to symbols in \cref{subsec:value_assignment}. After this, more complex syntactical constructs, such as actors, structures, loops and selective control structures, will be explained in \cref{subsec:actors,subsec:structs,subsec:forLoopStatements,subsec:ifStatements}.
