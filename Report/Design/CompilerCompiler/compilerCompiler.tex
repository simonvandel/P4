\section{Compiler Compiler Choice}
\label{sec:compiler_compiler_choice}

It has been decided to prioritize the programmers above simpler grammar, this means that it's is preferred to have complex grammar rather than changing the chosen syntax to get a simpler grammar. This has affected the grammar to be more complex, because of this it has been chosen to use a compiler compiler. The choice of compiler compiler was decided based on a series of criteria. The criteria set are listed below with the corresponding reason for the criteria.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Compile to C\# or F\#} It has been chosen to construct the compiler in F\#. Because F\# is compatible with common language infrastructure (CLI) as well as C\# it is possible to use any C\# code within F\#. This makes C\# a preferred target language for the compiler compiler as well as F\#. \\

\item \textbf{LR parser} The compiler compiler should support LR parsing because left recursions has been used in the grammar specifying the language. \\

\item \textbf{Action Code} The parser should support action code and grammar and action code should be in separated files.\\

\end{enumerate}
Two compiler compilers where found matching the criteria liste, HIME and sableCC. sabelCC does support LALR parsing which parses the same set of grammars as LR parser, which makes sabelCC a suitable parser. HIME has been choses as the compiler compiler because it was latest updated and target C\# as the main output language where SabelCC targets java and later on started supporting C\#.
