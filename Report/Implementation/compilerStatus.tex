\section{Compiler Status}\label{sec:compilerStatus}

The compiler developed for TLDR does not fully implement TLDR. This section lists which parts of TLDR is implemented in the compiler, and which parts are not.

Implemented:

\begin{itemize}
\item Arithmetic operations
\item And, or, equality operations on bools
\item For-in statement
\item Lists as arrays. See \cref{codegen:lists}
\item If and if-else statements
\item While loops
\item print, printint, printreal functions
\item Actors
\item Spawn, send, receive and die operations
\item Integer, boolean and real number constants
\item Struct definition, struct field access and initialisation
\item Initialisation and reassignment constructs
\end{itemize}

Not implemented:

\begin{itemize}
\item Functions - Code generation is not implemented
\item Dynamically allocated lists. The lists currently implemented are simply arrays. See \cref{codegen:lists}
\item Tuples - Code generation is not implemented
\item List operations - Currently lists can only be manipulated by indexing into the list and can be iterated with a for-in-loop
\item Data casts - Only supported in grammar
\item NAND, NOR and XOR - Code generation not implemented
\item Char constant - Code generation not implemented
\item Comparison of tuples, structs - Type checking and code generation not implemented
\item Send/receive of structs/tuples
\item Arguments from command line
\end{itemize}
