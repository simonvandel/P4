\section{Speed up}
\label{sup}
  For parallel computing, Gene Amdalh, defined a law for decribing the theoretical maximum speedup using multiple processors. The maximum speedup a system can achieve by parallelisation is limited to at most 20Ã—.
  The law can be used to describe the speed up achievable by a giving system, by the percentage of parallelisable code, in this equation.

  By this law maximising the percentage of parallelisable, the highest possible speed up achievable is increased, thereby improving the scaling of the solution on multiple processor.
