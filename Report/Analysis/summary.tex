\section{Summary}\label{analsum}

This section will, in light of the preceeding two chapters, \cref{part:analysis1} and \cref{part:analysis2}, settle on some criteria for The Language Described in this Report. The criteria are inspired by the ones found in \kanote{inds√¶t ref til sebesta bog}. However, only those characteristics which differentiates the language will be discussed, even if it might be present in the language. Such would be simplicity, which while being a cherishable trait, is not one that is either especially catered to.



Simplicty
orthogonality
data types
syntax design
support for abstraction
expressivity
type checking
exception handling
restricted aliasing
