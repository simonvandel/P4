\section{Shared Memory}

The shared memory model differentiates itself from the message passing approach by tasks having a shared address space. Because some memory can be shared across several tasks, memory usage is typically smaller than non-shared memory models.

Reads and writes of the shared memory occur asynchronously, so mechanisms for controlling access to the memory should be used in order to avoid race conditions and data corruption.
