As described in \cref{\jenote{find afsnit om hvorfor vi skal k√∏re parallelt}} most simulations are very heavy and need HPC to operate at resonable speeds. Furthermore HPC runs parallel to utilize the performance of multiple processors. On modern architectures parallelism is achieved via system threads. Threads can also be made concurrent if wanted but to achieve parallelism threads are needed. As described in \cref{sec:models}, models are used as the conceptional still images of simulations and general dynamic behaviour.  We therefore need a way to create models that can operate parallel. Threads are not easy to use to abstract over the definition of models. Since this language focuses heavily on models and simulations a more compatible abstraction is needed.

If we look at the definition given earlier about models they consist of a general theory and a description of objects and systems. This is a definition
