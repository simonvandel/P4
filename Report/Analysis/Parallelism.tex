\section{Parallelism}

In the continues effort of trying to squeeze as much power out of computers as possible, the computerscientific community are at a point where increasing the speed of processors is no longer as viable a solution as it used to be. This has spawned an increased interest in finding computational power in other ways, one being parallelism.

Parallelism is the act of dividing calculations into independently solveable parts, and then solving them on multiple processors before finally gathering the individual results and combining them. The main benefit of parallelising anything is to gain \emph{speed up} in the computation time of problems. This will be described in \cref{sup}.

With parallelism you gain \emph{speed up} through combining multiple processing units. This is seen in newer CPU's as multicores, but on a larger scale this principle can be used create supercomputers, capable of performing immense calculations.

But even without a supercomputer a distributed network of multiple computers can provide with a large amounts of parallel computing power. With this being a forseable future, we predict an increase in the access to, and need for, parallel systems.
