\section{Users}
\label{sec:users}

The main focus of the project is to create a programming language for parallel computing. Besides that it has been chosen to delimit the scope of the project further more by choosing a target group for the language. Making a general purpose language optimized for parallel programming, is a problem that have they have attempted solve many times\cite{parallel programming languages}. 

The aim of the project is not to solve this problem, but rather focusing on one creating a language of solve a specific group of problems. The programming language will be focusing on solving physics simulation problems. It has been assumed that this kind of problems often is nondeterministic which benefits the project because the most parallel programming models introduces nondeterministic computations. 

This makes the target user group of the language physicists and mathematicians. Which also has to be in mind doing the development phase of the language.
