The Hime parser generator is a parser generator for the .Net platform (including Mono on Linux and MacOS) and Java.
It primarily supports the LR family of parsing methods, including GLR (Generalized-LR).
Parsers generated with this tool need the appropriate runtime contained in this package.

This package is a standalone distribution of the binaries for the .Net and Java platforms.
It contains:
* .Net assemblies and debug symbols for the parsers runtime, SDK API and command-line tool
* Java artifacts and debug symbols for the parsers runtime
